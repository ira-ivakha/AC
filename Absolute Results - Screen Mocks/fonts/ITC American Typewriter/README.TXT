A NOTE ABOUT ITC AMERICAN TYPEWRITER (R)

ITC American Typewriter was designed by Joel Kaden and Tony Stan in 1974.
They designed two versions of the lowercase e, uppercase R, ampersand and
dollar.  Fonts with the letter "A" at the end of their names include the
alternate versions, while the standard versions are in the fonts without
an "A". Both versions of each font are identical except for these
characters.

Many PC applications have separate menus for selecting typeface families and
typeface styles. Most applications let you choose among regular, bold, and
italic styles in the Style menu. However, some Adobe Type Library packages
include font software with additional style variations and stroke weight
variations. To select these variations, you need to know how the bold and
italic styles are linked to the base typeface. For example, the New Caledonia
typeface includes semi-bold, bold, and black. To use New Caledonia Black, you
need to choose New Caledonia SemiBold from the application's Font menu (or
equivalent), and then choose Bold from the Style menu (or equivalent).

If you are using a Microsoft Windows application, Ventura Publisher or
Microsoft Word, follow the guide to typeface style selection below. (The
Microsoft Word menu name will be as listed below but with any spaces in it
removed.) If you are using an application other than these, refer to the
application's documentation.

If you are reading this document using Windows Notepad, please make sure to
set your left and right margins to zero before printing.
